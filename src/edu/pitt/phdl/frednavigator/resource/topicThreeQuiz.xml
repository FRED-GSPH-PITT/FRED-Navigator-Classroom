      <ns1:questionText>The green curve represents an incidence with R0=1.4 with no school closure. The red curve represents an incidence curve if each school closes for 4 weeks once 10 students attending that school get sick. The school closure policy reduces incidence at first but then increases later.
      </ns1:questionText>
      <ns1:answerText> Why does this happen?
          Can you explain the timing of the second wave of illness?

      <ns1:questionText>The green curve represents an attack rate curve with R0=1.4 with no school closure.  Let's call this the baseline. The red curve represents the attack rate curve if each school closes for 4 weeks once 10 students attending that school get sick.
      </ns1:questionText>
      <ns1:answerText> Can you explain the shape of the red attack rate curve?
          Would it be possible for the school closure attack rate to be higher than the baseline?
          Why or why not?
