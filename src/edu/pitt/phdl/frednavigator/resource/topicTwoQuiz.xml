        <ns1:questionText>The red curve represents an incidence curve due to an epidemic with R0 = 2.0 with no immunization in the population.</ns1:questionText>
        <ns1:answerText> Which of the other curves might represents an epidemic with R0 = 2.0 at the same place, if 30% of the population immunized?
            Why?

        <ns1:questionText>The curves above show the incidence curves due to an epidemic with R0 = 2.4 if there is no immunity in the population and if half the population is immunized.</ns1:questionText>
        <ns1:answerText> When does the peak of the epidemic occur in both cases?
            How long does immunization delay the peak in this case?
            How might this affect the length of lines at health care clinics?

        <ns1:questionText> The curves above show that the attack rate due to an epidemic with R0 = 2.4 is about 80% if there is no immunity in the population, but drops to about 20% if half the population is immunized.</ns1:questionText>
        <ns1:answerText>Why does immunizing 50% of the population decrease the number of people getting infected by 75% ?</ns1:answerText>
