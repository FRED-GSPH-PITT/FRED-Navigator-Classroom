About the FRED Simulator
</em>
</h3>
<p>
FRED (A Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics) is a
modeling system that supports research on the dynamics of infectious
disease epidemics and the interacting effects of mitigation strategies,
viral evolution, and personal health behavior. FRED was designed as a
flexible, modular, open source framework for epidemic modeling, rather
than a model of a particular infectious disease. Key features of FRED
include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Highly modular, object-oriented software design to support rapid
adaptation to a wide variety of infectious disease scenarios.
</li>
<p>
<li>
Realistic synthetic populations based on the US Census Bureau's Public
Use Microdata (PUMs) data and Census aggregated data. The synthetic
populations used by FRED were developed by RTI International as part of
the MIDAS project and are freely available.
</li>
<p>
<li>
Scalable and efficient simulation of large epidemics. FRED can run on a
variety of computer platforms from laptops to supercomputers, depending
on the size of the population being simulated. Simulations of an
influenza epidemic like the H1N1 pandemic in a population of 1 million
people takes less than 2 minutes on a laptop computer.
</li>
<p>
<li>
Flexible ways to specify agent health behavior and decision
rules. Agents in FRED may exhibit a number of health-related behaviors
involving individual health decisions, such as staying home when sick,
accepting a vaccine or taking an anti-viral drug. The FRED platform is
designed to accommodate a range of models of health behavior and
supports a variety of strategies to determine an agent's willingness to
adopt a behavior.

Synthetic Population
</h4>
<p>
FRED explicitly represents every individual in a specific geographic
region. Each agent has a set of socio-demographic characteristics and
daily behaviors that include age, sex, employment status, occupation,
and household location and membership in a set of social contact
networks. Each household, school, and workplace is mapped to a specific
geographic location, reflecting the actual spatial distribution of the
area and the distance travelled by individuals to work or to school. For
regions within the United States, FRED uses the

2005-2009 U.S. Synthetic
Population Database (Version 2)</a>
 from RTI International, a partner in the MIDAS Network.
<p>
The RTI Synthetic Population uses an iterative fitting method to
generate an agent population from the US Census Bureau's Public Use
Microdata files (PUMs) and aggregated data from the 2005-2009 American
Community Survey (ACS) 5-year sample. The synthetic population database
contains geographically located synthetic households and household
residents for the United States, as well as group quarters locations and
residents, schools and assignments of students to schools, workplaces
and assignments of workers to workplaces. Each household, group
quarters, school and workplace is mapped to a specific geographic
location, reflecting the actual spatial distribution of the area and the
distance travelled by individuals to work or to school. Each agent has
associated demographic information (e.g., age, sex), locations for
social activities (household, and possibly school or workplace).
<p>
A FRED synthetic population is currently available for every county in
the United States and for selected international populations. FRED can
simulate any combination of counties in a single run, for example, an
epidemic within a state or a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).

<h4>Why FRED?</h4>
<p>

FRED was named in tribute to Fred McFeely Rogers (1928-2003), a famous
Pittsburgher best known for his television program Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood (1968-2001). Mr. Rogers' theme song included the phrases:
<p>
<em>
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood ... won't you be my neighbor?
</em>
<p>
His emphasis of the importance of neighborhoods seems like an
appropriate reflection of the importance of social networks in the FRED
simulation system.
